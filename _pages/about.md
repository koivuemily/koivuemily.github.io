Hi there! My name is Emily Koivu, and I am a dissertation-year Ph.D. candidate working with Dr. Christopher Hirata at THE Ohio State University. Some of my research interests include primordial black holes as dark matter, Hawking radiation, reionization and cosmic dawn observables, and lots more! 

On this website, you'll find a bit about my scientific work. In addition to my scientific pursuits, I am a huge fan of reading, fiber arts, and dancing! Much of my free time is also consumed by advocacy work. My educational journey has been filled with mentors and people who actively choose to create more welcoming scientific environments, so I am doing my best to further the work towards a more inclusive academic space. 

I am always thrilled to hear from interested people, so please reach out if you have questions or thoughts (about science or anythign else)!
